"""Tests in this file validate `render_agent_md_file` located at `src/agentic_devkit/tdd_lint/agentic_linter/render_agent_md_file.py`.
`render_agent_md_file` is responsible for creating one isolated single-test `.agent.md` with a pending review scorecard.

Terms:
- `single-test packet`: A single-test packet is the `.agent.md` file for one test. For example, it contains one test and its pending review scorecard.
- `iterative review`: Iterative review records original scoring, bounded revision attempts, and final clarity comparison for one packet.
- `Test Content`: Test Content is the packet section containing the original extracted test source. For example, the final scorecard evaluates this source after considering hypothetical revisions.
