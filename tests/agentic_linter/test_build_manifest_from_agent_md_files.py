"""Tests in this file validate `build_manifest_from_agent_md_files` located at `src/agentic_tdd_linter/agentic_linter/build_manifest_from_agent_md_files.py`.
`build_manifest_from_agent_md_files` is responsible for converting completed `.agent.md` reviews into manifest proof and validating existing proof stored by default in `tests/agentic_review_manifest.jsonl`.
Changing one test invalidates only that test's proof.

Terms:
- `manifest proof`: Manifest proof records a completed review for a test. Proof becomes stale when it no longer matches test content, and proof becomes orphaned when its test no longer exists.
- `review contract`: The review contract includes the linter criteria and repository review documentation. For example, changing README.md changes the contract.
