"""Tests in this file validate `render_cross_test_agent_md_file` located at `src/agentic_devkit/tdd_lint/agentic_linter/render_cross_test_agent_md_file.py`.
`render_cross_test_agent_md_file` is responsible for creating an isolated cross-test `.agent.md` and determining whether that packet remains valid.

Terms:
- `cross-test packet`: A docstring-only review of relationships among tests.
- `pair classification`: An unordered pair's requirement overlap and, when applicable, difference kind.
- `Similar Coverage`: Docstring entries naming an overlapping test, difference kind, and explanation.

        Verification Method: verify public function output

        Verification Detail:
        The `cross-test packet` contains ``Happy/Failure Path Difference: `<file.py>::<test_name>```.
        The `cross-test packet` contains ``Scenario Difference: `<file.py>::<test_name>```.
        The `cross-test packet` contains ``Module Difference: `<file.py>::<test_name>```.
        The `cross-test packet` contains `Explanation: <specific difference between the two tests>`.

        Similar Coverage:
        - Scenario Difference: `test_render_cross_test_agent_md_file.py::test_requires_reciprocal_references`
          Explanation: The current test verifies `render_cross_test_agent_md_file` shows the exact `Similar Coverage` format for every supported difference kind. The named test verifies `render_cross_test_agent_md_file` generates a `cross-test packet` stating that an overlapping pair provides reciprocal entries with the same difference classification; both use happy path, but exercise materially different scenarios.
