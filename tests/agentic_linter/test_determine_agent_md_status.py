"""Tests in this file validate `determine_agent_md_status` located at `src/agentic_devkit/tdd_lint/agentic_linter/determine_agent_md_status.py`.
`determine_agent_md_status` is responsible for deriving review status and reporting malformed `.agent.md` scorecards.

Terms:
- `.agent.md`: An .agent.md file contains one agent-review scorecard. For example, each criterion row has one review result.
- `invalid_review_scorecard`: invalid_review_scorecard identifies a malformed agent-review scorecard. For example, one result cell containing both pass and fail is invalid.
