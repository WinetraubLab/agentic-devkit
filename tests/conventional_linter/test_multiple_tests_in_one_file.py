"""Tests in this file validate `conventional_linter` located at `src/agentic_devkit/tdd_lint/conventional_linter/run_conventional_linter.py`.
`conventional_linter` is responsible for validating every extracted test independently when a file contains multiple tests.

Terms:
- `JSDoc`: JSDoc is the documentation comment attached to a TypeScript test. For example, a block beginning slash-star-star can contain Requirement Tested.
