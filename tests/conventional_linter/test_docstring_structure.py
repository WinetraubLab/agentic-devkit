"""Tests in this file validate `conventional_linter` located at `src/agentic_devkit/tdd_lint/conventional_linter/run_conventional_linter.py`.
`conventional_linter` is responsible for enforcing test documentation, naming, and visual-inspection conventions.

Terms:
- `Test Path`: Test Path is the structured field naming a test's scenario category. For example, Test Path can contain happy path.
- `Requirement Tested`: Requirement Tested is the structured field stating behavior and scenario. For example, it says that a parser accepts valid text.
- `Verification Method`: Verification Method is the structured field naming the observation approach. For example, it can say verify public function output.
- `Verification Detail`: Verification Detail is the structured field stating exact evidence. For example, it says that `_add_values` output equals three.
- `Inspection Instructions`: Inspection Instructions is the structured field that authorizes source inspection when linter issues cannot describe visual evidence. For example, it can name a specific module to inspect.
