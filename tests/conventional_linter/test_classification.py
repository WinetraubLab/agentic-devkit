"""Tests in this file validate `conventional_linter` located at `src/agentic_devkit/tdd_lint/conventional_linter/run_conventional_linter.py`.
`conventional_linter` is responsible for validating test-path and verification-method classifications.

Terms:
- `happy path`: Happy path labels a test scenario where parser input succeeds. For example, a parser accepts a supported value on the happy path.
- `failure path`: Failure path labels a test scenario where parser input is rejected. For example, a parser reports malformed syntax on the failure path.
- `supported methods`: Supported methods are public function output, private function output, and visual inspection by user. For example, conventional linter accepts public function output.
- `invalid_verification_method`: This rule identifies a Verification Method value outside supported methods. For example, verify database state produces invalid_verification_method.
- `visual inspection contract`: A visual inspection contract requires `visual inspection by user`, an artifact path, inspection instructions, and an artifact-writing helper call. For example, a rendering test documents an image path and inspection steps and invokes `write_visual_inspection_artifact`.
