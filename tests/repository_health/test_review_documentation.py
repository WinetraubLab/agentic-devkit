"""Tests in this file validate `test_review_documentation` located at `tests/repository_health/test_review_documentation.py`.
`test_review_documentation` is responsible for requiring README.md and docs/workflows/github-actions.md to document the supported pre-commit review and CI/CD validation workflows.

Terms:
- `.agent.md`: An .agent.md file contains one generated agent-review scorecard. For example, the pre-commit workflow creates and reviews .agent.md files before lint records proof.
- `$run-tdd-linter`: The $run-tdd-linter skill runs the repository's agentic TDD review workflow. For example, a coding agent invokes it after installation.
- `pre-commit review workflow`: The pre-commit review workflow orders three stages: run `agentic-tdd-linter create-agent-md` to create `.agent.md` files, complete their scorecards, and run lint to persist proof.
- `CI/CD validation workflow`: The CI/CD validation workflow validates committed tests and manifest proof without creating scorecards. For example, GitHub Actions runs lint after changes are committed.
