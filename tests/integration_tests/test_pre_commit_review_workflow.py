"""Tests in this file validate `pre-commit review workflow` located at `src/agentic_tdd_linter/cli/run_lint_pipeline.py`.
`pre-commit review workflow` is responsible for maintaining test-review evidence before commit.

Terms:
- `pre-commit review workflow`: The pre-commit review workflow completes the review lifecycle before changes are committed. For example, it refreshes stale scorecards before commit.
- `.agent.md`: An .agent.md file contains one generated agent-review scorecard. For example, create-agent-md regenerates the edited test's .agent.md file.
- `cross_test_review.agent.md`: The cross_test_review.agent.md file reviews relationships among the complete selected test set. For example, create-agent-md --fresh regenerates the cross-test review.
- `agent_review_failed`: The agent_review_failed issue identifies a completed review containing failed criteria. For example, lint emits this issue with skill-based correction guidance.
- `$run-tdd-linter`: The $run-tdd-linter skill coordinates correction of TDD lint failures. For example, failure output directs a coding agent to run this skill.

        Requirement Tested:
        `pre-commit review workflow` removes an obsolete single-test `.agent.md` during ordinary generation.
        Specialized usage: A caller invokes packet generation a second time after renaming test_current to test_renamed. On the second invocation, `pre-commit review workflow` removes test_current's `.agent.md` because it is now obsolete.

        Verification Method: verify public function output

        Verification Detail:
        `_packet_paths` output initially contains the original function's packet.
        `_packet_paths` output excludes the obsolete packet after the test function is renamed.

        - Scenario Difference: `test_pre_commit_review_workflow.py::test_refresh_scenario`
          Explanation: The current test verifies `pre-commit review workflow` removes an obsolete single-test `.agent.md` during ordinary generation. The named test verifies `pre-commit review workflow` replaces the complete `.agent.md` set with one pending single-test file per current test and one pending cross-test file when create-agent-md runs with unscoped --fresh; both use happy path, but exercise materially different scenarios.
        - Scenario Difference: `test_pre_commit_review_workflow.py::test_lint_ignores_obsolete_pending_packets`
          Explanation: The current test verifies ordinary generation removes an obsolete individual packet. The named test verifies lint ignores obsolete pending packets when manifest proof is current; both use happy path, but exercise materially different scenarios.
        - Happy/Failure Path Difference: `test_pre_commit_review_workflow.py::test_stale_test_requires_review`
          Explanation: The current test verifies ordinary generation removes an obsolete individual packet. The named test verifies an edited test creates only its packet and related relationship rows; the current test is happy path, while the named test is failure path.
