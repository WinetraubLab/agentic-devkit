"""Tests in this file validate `create-agent-md` located at `src/agentic_devkit/tdd_lint/cli/run_lint_pipeline.py`.
`create-agent-md` is responsible for loading and validating Python and TypeScript tests before creating their review scorecards.

Terms:
- `.py`: This suffix identifies a Python test file. For example, `test_parser.py` contains Python tests discovered by the CLI.
- `.test.ts`: This suffix identifies a TypeScript test file. For example, `parser.test.ts` contains TypeScript tests discovered by the CLI.
- `packet set`: A packet set contains one single-test `.agent.md` file populated with a discovered test's documentation and source and one cross-test `.agent.md` file populated with test identifiers and docstrings, excluding test implementation.

        Verification Detail:
        1. Harness creates one file declaring `parser` and containing a requirement that does not identify parser.
